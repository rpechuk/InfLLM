## Tailwind CSS Setup

- Tailwind is configured via `globals.css` and a `tailwind.config.js` file (see project root).
- To customize Tailwind or enable purging, edit `tailwind.config.js`.

## Prettier Plugin for Tailwind

To automatically sort and deduplicate Tailwind classes, install the Prettier plugin:

```bash
npm install -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

This will help keep your Tailwind classes clean and consistent.
